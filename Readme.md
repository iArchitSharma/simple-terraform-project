## Real-Time DevOps Project: Automated Static Website Hosting with Terraform and AWS
In this Real-Time DevOps project, I utilized Terraform and AWS Cloud to set up fully automated static website hosting. This Terraform project provided valuable insights into the concepts and operations of Terraform with AWS, demonstrating how to create a one-click automated solution using Terraform in DevOps.

### Key Features
- Automated Infrastructure: Provision AWS resources using Terraform to host a static website.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage infrastructure through code for reproducibility and version control.
- AWS Integration: Leverage AWS services for scalable and reliable hosting.
